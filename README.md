# Hot Dog or Not Hot Dog ðŸŒ­

> "I can only do hot dog, not hot dog. Nothing else."

[HuggingFace Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/habuTusk/seefood)

This recreates Jian-Yang's "Not Hotdog" app from [Silicon Valley Season 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWwCK95X6go), where the character builds a simple binary classifier that can only identify hot dogs.

## How It Works

It uses a fine-tuned ResNet-18 convolutional neural network built with FastAI to distinguish between hot dog and not hot dog images.

**Architecture:**
- Pre-trained ResNet-18 model
- Transfer learning with 4 epochs of fine-tuning
- Binary classification (hot dog vs not hot dog)
- 192x192 pixel image input

## Installation

- Install [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd seefood
```

2. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate seefood
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will launch and be available at `http://localhost:7860`

## Files
- `app.py` - Main Gradio application
- `model.pkl` - Pre-trained FastAI model
- `environment.yml` - Conda environment specification
- `hot_dog.jpg` - Example hotdog image
- `not_hotdog.jpg` - Example non-hotdog image

## Usage
1. Upload an image or select from the examples
2. The model will classify it as either "hotdog" or "not_hotdog"
3. View the confidence scores for each category
